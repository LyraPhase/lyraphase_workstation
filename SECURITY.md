# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| <2.0    | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, file an issue on this GitHub repo describing the problem.
Please try to provide a Pull Request to fix the issue, because I am the sole maintainer,
and I still have a day job.

If the issue _is not_ against dependencies of this repo (up to and including Chef / ChefDK),
I will try to merge the PR & issue a bugfix release ASAP.

The scope of security vulnerabilities should address this repo's code, as anything in dependencies or Chef itself is considered upstream.
