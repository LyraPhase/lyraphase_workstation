# A basic wrapper class to avoid ChefSpec ruby_block testing problems:
#  1. Only implements minimum used methods for parent Chef::Util::FileEdit class to avoid unintended side-effects
#  2. Separating this code out of ruby_block lets us test & exercise the code using a Mock Object and test fixture config file
